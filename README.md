# SymptoGuide

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Community Connection Challenge - The Local Services Trust Problem**

Develop an intelligent healthcare assistance system that helps users understand and categorize their
symptoms, providing a preliminary, non-diagnostic assessment and guiding them toward appropriate medical
experts or hospitals. The system should analyze user-reported symptoms, identify potential concern areas, and
offer tailored suggestions such as nearby specialized hospitals, emergency indicators, and recommended
departments or specialists.
The goal is to support users with early symptom awareness, reduce confusion during medical decision-making,
and streamline access to suitable healthcare services—while clearly emphasizing that it does not replace
professional medical diagnosis.
